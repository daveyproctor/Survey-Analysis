Women (generally) care more about their health and CS is fucking terrible for your overall physical health (no sleep, excessive caffeine, days without being able to do normal things like exercise, etc).  CS also requires A LOT of struggling and men are less likely to doubt themselves when they struggle.  Thus even though men and women may struggle the same in a class, men don't think their struggling means they're bad at CS whearas the inevitable struggle CS requires causes women to think CS isn't for them.  CS is also just a competitive environment - who has the fastest code, who is taking the hardest classes, who has the most impressive internship etc.  I like this - it drives me to pay attention to strategies that other people are using and to work hard.  But the women I know in CS generally don't like this.  I think that competativeness is inevitable in anything as difficult but lucrative as CS, and any attempts to make CS classes easier or less stressful would piss people off who want to challenge themselves and learn.","Since I'm in three CS classes now, it means I interact with men more than I do with women.  Also most of the people I think are above and beyond smart are men - simply because men are in more of my classes and thus are top students in more of my classes.

In other classes I think it was about 30-40% women whereas grad classes I've taken have been 10-20%, with there being 3-5 women in the class other than me. This reminds me of the job application problem that you frequently hear related to women vs. men. Women won't apply for a job unless they meet all the qualifications vs men will. Despite telling several of my female friends that they could handle a grad class (which are frequently easier than undergrad classes), they won't take them because of the prerequisites and because they think they'll be really hard. Eddie Kohler did a great job at the end of 61 this past semester encouraging students to take grad classes (saying that sometimes they're easier than undergrad classes) and I think we need more of that. I also think it would help to change the prerequisites. I acknowledge that part of this may be to deter enrollment to keep class sizes down but I think this is disproportionately deterring women. Maybe lotteries would be better? (As much as I hate that idea). ",It's nerve-wracking to take a grad class because I know there will be very few women in the class.

It's the same reasons that poor and rural kids don't typically excel here either, and while the CS department definitely has made some strides to become more accessible, I don't feel like Harvard as whole has.  It's big fish eats little fish here, and those with structural advantages typically win.","Well, for all Harvard talks about having a ""diverse"" community and championing that as a value of our education, I can't help but notice the remarkable amount of de jure segregation.  In my CS classes, the complete lack of contact I have with women in an academic context will only make me further unprepared to work with them in the workplace, further exacerbating the whole issue of women not being accepted, etc.  Luckily, I've taken measures to help avoid that problem (like declaring a Secondary in a humanity, to some degree just to interact with a different group of peers than I see in our CS/Math/Stat Conclaves).  However, it'd be great if my education, by design, equipped me with that, rather than me having to seek it out.  Especially given the extent to which Harvard rigs the admissions process to recalibrate minority representations (and then brags about those rigged statistics), we might as well try to promote the diversity we advertise on our brochures.  But if all I see at Harvard is rich white kids partying with rich white kids (final clubs), nerdy men (with the occasional Asian/Jewish girl) toiling for hours over STEM psets, elitest prep kids dominating small humanities seminars,  pre-professional Asian kids from the same 5-6 elite public schools (WWP, Stuyvesant, Palo Alto HS,... you know the list) trading problem sets solns, positions in HFAC, HCCG, HCS, etc. , and minority students forced into ""easy"" Social Science concentrations due to the lack of help and advising  -- see http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/3/23/fritz-we-cant-wait/ -- I start to wonder how much ""diversity"" I'm really experiencing in my education, given the way most students wall themselves off into these groups.  Don't get me wrong, I have seen wonderful exceptions to these patterns, but it's often IN SPITE of the structural issues in Harvard and the elite education game, rather than because of support by the University and its departments.  I don't blame Harvard alone or expect it to fix all these problems perfectly, but I don't feel satisfied with the way these issues are tackled currently.  Ah well, I'm rambling; I'm gonna chug some addy and spend the next 14 hours grinding on this 124 pset in my room.  Peace.  "

Also the tech industry (where many people in CS go after college) is known as a very hostile environment for women, which I think keeps a lot of us from choosing it as a path. Related to college: the introductory CS courses here in particular idolize this image of a stereotypically male hacker/programmer/bro which I think is not only alienating to those who don't fit that description or feel uncomfortable in that sort of environment, but is also not at all an accurate indicator of what computer science is actually about. I know women who never took CS again after CS50 because they thought that was what all CS was like, which is really a shame. Also, male students who do come in with more experience in CS (and even ones who don't) can have rather show-offy and competitive attitudes that make women feel uncomfortable and excluded.","I certainly haven't enjoyed the gender gap in CS at Harvard, partially because it is harder to find people to work with and partially because I feel like I have to work harder and do better to be taken seriously as a female CS student. I have had experiences where men in my CS class who knew nothing about my background or skill level would not let me work with them on problem sets or group assignments because they said I ""couldn't handle the work"" or, more confusingly, ""wouldn't like their work environment"". (I have also been told that being excluded was ""for my own good"".) I don't really feel like I fit into the typical CS class demographic/environment, which is a large part of why I chose not to concentrate in CS even though it's one of the subjects I most love to study."

A lot of times, TFs are male and they explain things to women in a way that is really condescending.  For example, a lot of male TFs (and male students, for that matter) will use up-speak at the end of sentences when explaining something to a woman, will explain things at a level that is so detailed to be insulting, and/or will constantly ask, ""Does that make sense?"" which some might find insulting.

Male TFs in introductory courses (I'm looking at you, CS51 and CS124) also spend way, way more time at office hours helping female students with their problem sets than they do male students.  I've seen, on a number occasions, a male TF completely ignore all of the male students who were waiting in a queue to ask him a question because an attractive female student walks into the roomâ€” the male TF will immediately go over to her and spend the next 30 minutes talking with her and showing her how the code is best written or the problem is best done.  On one hand, this behavior might be good in the short term, since female CS students are a minority and the behavior provides them with extra support.  However, in the long term, I have to think that this sort of behavior makes female students feel uncomfortable with taking future CS classes; no one wants to be ogled by a male TF while seeking help with her homework.  ","I think that our CS department is really missing out on a lot of smart minds by not doing a good enough job of recruiting/keeping female students.  There are a lot of really smart female students at this school who would have made great classmates, project partners, and (when I was a TF) students if they had decided to go into CS.  But because of the current CS environment here, they didn't go into CS, so I missed out on that."
