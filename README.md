This Jupyter Notebook introduces the techniques needed to analyze correlations (for now, gender) among the CS50 survey responders.

## How to:

Open a terminal

new directory

git clone

move survey responses into the directory as responses.csv

## Running the Jupyter Notebook:

You can use a virtual environment (http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) if you'd like (if there are versions of other python libraries you'd like to protect)

in a terminal:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ jupyter notebook

This will open a tab in Chrome. click on Analyze_responses.ipynb to run the notebook. http://jupyter.org/ for info on how the notebook works (not hard to learn if you know Python). Ask me if any Qs.
